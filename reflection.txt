"Using branches is powerful because they let developers work on new features or fixes without changing the main branch right away. Each person can work on their own branch, which keeps the main code stable and working.Branches help prevent problems like broken code, lost work, and merge conflicts. If something goes wrong, the issue stays in the branch and does not affect the main project. This makes teamwork safer and easier, especially when multiple people are working on the same project at the same time."
